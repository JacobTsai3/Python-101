# Week 1: Rock Paper Scissors

This is a recap of what we covered in our first session last week. Follow along and then try to work on the project described at the bottom of this page. 

## Variables

Variables are names given to values. For example:

```python
# A variable called `name` with the value "Jacob"
name = "Jacob"

# A variable called `favorite_number` with the value 13
favorite_number = 13
```

## Types

In Python, types are not explicitly set, but you have already learned about two types of data:

```python
# `name` has the value "Jacob", which is of type String
name = "Jacob"

# `favorite_number` has the value 13, which is of type integer, often called int
favorite_number = 13
```

## Calling Functions

Functions are named parts in code that can be "called". For example:

```python
# `name` has the value "Jacob", which is of type String
name = "Jacob"

# `favorite_number` has the value 13, which is of type integer, often called int
favorite_number = 13

# A function `print` is called, with the parameter "Your name is " is passed in
print("Your name is ")

# A function `print` is called, with the parameter `name`, which has the value "Jacob" is passed in
print(name)
```

Before continuing, do the following:
1. Open Visual Studio Code

# Week 1: Rock Paper Scissors

This is a recap of what we covered in our first session last week. Follow along and then try to work on the project described at the bottom of this page. 

## Variables

Variables are names given to values. For example:

```python
# A variable called `name` with the value "Jacob"
name = "Jacob"

# A variable called `favorite_number` with the value 13
favorite_number = 13
```

## Types

In Python, types are not explicitly set, but you have already learned about two types of data:

```python
# `name` has the value "Jacob", which is of type String
name = "Jacob"

# `favorite_number` has the value 13, which is of type integer, often called int
favorite_number = 13
```

## Calling Functions

Functions are named parts in code that can be "called". For example:

```python
# `name` has the value "Jacob", which is of type String
name = "Jacob"

# `favorite_number` has the value 13, which is of type integer, often called int
favorite_number = 13

# A function `print` is called, with the parameter "Your name is " is passed in
print("Your name is ")

# A function `print` is called, with the parameter `name`, which has the value "Jacob" is passed in
print(name)
```

### Get VSCode ready
Before continuing, let's make sure your VS Code is setup for what we will be doing next:
1. Open Visual Studio Code
2. At the bottom of VS Code, check to see if you're on the main branch (it will say `main`)
![Branch at the bottom of the VSCode window](../assets/main-branch-pull.png)
3. If it doesn't say main, check to see if you have any pending commits. If you do, you will have a number on the Source Control tab:
![Source control with a notification showing uncommitted changes](../assets/uncommitted-changes.png)
4. If you have uncommitted changes, click into the Source Control pane, type a message at the top of the pane, click the check mark button. Then press Sync Changes.
![Source Control panel open in VS Code with a commit in progress](../assets/commit-view.png)
5. After you have synced your changes, you should no longer have a notification on the Source Control button. 
6. At the bottom of VSCode again, click on the name of the branch and when the branch chooser pops up, click `main`

7. Click on the arrow circle to pull down changes.

Your File Explorer pane should now look like this:
